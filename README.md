# Hey there!👋 

I'm Juliana, and I'm passionate about blending technology and human resources! With a strong experience in HR and a burning passion for technology, I bring a unique perspective to the table. Currently, I'm working as a Recruitment Manager at [Optimal Hunters](https://www.optimalhunters.com/), where I leverage my HR expertise to ensure our clients attract the best and brightest talent.

But here's the exciting part—I'm not your typical HR professional. Over the past few years, I've immersed myself in the world of technology, particularly Python Programming and Machine Learning. It's safe to say I'm hooked! I believe that the strategic use of data can revolutionize HR and create positive change in people's lives.

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities that allow me to marry my tech skills with my love for HR. My passion for Data Science and cutting-edge technology keeps me constantly in search of ways to use them to make the workplace, and perhaps the world, a better place.

So, if you're looking for someone who is passionate about both HR and technology, who can bring a fresh perspective to the table, and who is always ready for new challenges, look no further—I'm your person!
