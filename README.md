# Hey there!👋 

✨ Hey there, I'm Juliana from Colombia, and I'm all about HR Data Analytics! For the past few years, I've been diving headfirst into the world of Python programming and Machine Learning, and I've gotta say, I'm hooked. I'm all about using data to drive positive change in HR, and I get seriously jazzed when I see the impact it can have on people's lives.

Right now, I'm working as a Recruitment Manager at [Optimal Hunters](http://www.optimalhunters.com/), where I'm making sure the company is bringing on the best and brightest. But honestly, I'm always on the hunt for new opportunities where I can combine my tech skills with my love for HR. I'm a total tech nerd and innovation junkie, and I believe that Data Science has the power to change the world (or at least make it a little better). So if you're looking for someone who's passionate about HR, tech-savvy, and always down for a new challenge, I'm your person!
